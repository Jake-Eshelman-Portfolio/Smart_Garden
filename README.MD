# Plant Watering System with nRF52dk and FreeRTOS

## Overview
This project automates the watering of plants using an nRF52 Development Kit (nRF52dk) and FreeRTOS. 
It utilizes moisture sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and controls a water pump/motor to irrigate the plants when necessary. 
The skills I wanted to work on in this project are ADC signal handling, learning FreeRTOS, object oriented design with C++, 
driver development, and motor control.

## Features
- Soil moisture monitoring with multiple sensors
- Automated watering using a step-controlled motor
- FreeRTOS for task management and real-time operation
- Integration of ADC for sensor data acquisition

## Components
- nRF52 Development Kit (nRF52dk)
- Capacitive soil moisture sensors
- ADS1115 ADC (if additional ADC channels are required)
- Small water pump or stepper motor
- L298N motor driver
- 12V power adapter (or suitable power supply)
- Relays or transistors
- Resistors and capacitors
- Jumper wires
