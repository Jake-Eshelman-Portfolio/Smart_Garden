# Plant Watering System with nRF52dk and FreeRTOS

## Overview
This project automates the watering of plants using an nRF52 Development Kit (nRF52dk) and FreeRTOS. 
It utilizes moisture sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and controls a water pump/motor to irrigate the plants when necessary. 
The skills I wanted to work on in this project are ADC signal handling, learning FreeRTOS, object oriented design with C++, 
driver development, and motor control.

## Features
- Soil moisture monitoring with multiple sensors
- Automated watering using a step-controlled motor
- FreeRTOS for task management and real-time operation
- Integration of ADC for sensor data acquisition

## Components
- nRF52 Development Kit (nRF52dk) 
- Capacitive soil moisture sensors -- https://www.tindie.com/products/miceuz/i2c-soil-moisture-sensor/, documentation: https://github.com/Miceuz/i2c-moisture-sensor/blob/master/README.md
- Small water pump and tubing -- Gikfun 12V DC Dosing Pump Peristaltic (Amazon)
- L298N motor driver -- powered with a 12V battery, powering the nRF52dk via 5V power.
- Jumper wires
